| CodeGenerator config overrides
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| It is a good idea to sperate your configuration form the code-generator's
| own configuration. This way you won't lose any settings/preference
| you have when upgrading to a new version of the package.
|
| Additionally, you will always know any the configuration difference between
| the default config than your own.
|
| To override the setting that is found in the codegenerator.php file, you'll
| need to create identical key here with a different value
|
| IMPORTANT: When overriding an option that is an array, the configurations
| are merged together using php's array_merge() function. This means that
| any option that you list here will take presence during a conflict in keys.
|
| EXAMPLE: The following addition to this file, will add another entry in
| the common_definitions collection
|
|   'common_definitions' =>
|   [
|       [
|           'match' => '*_at',
|           'set' => [
|               'css-class' => 'datetime-picker',
|           ],
|       ],
|   ],
|
