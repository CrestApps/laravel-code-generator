    | CodeGenerator config overrides
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | It is a good idea to separate your configuration form the code-generator's
    | own configuration. This way you won't lose any settings/preference
    | you have when upgrading to a new version of the package.
    |
    | Additionally, you will always know any the configuration difference between
    | the default config than your own.
    |
    | To override the setting that is found in the codegenerator.php file, you'll
    | need to create identical key here with a different value
    |
    | IMPORTANT: When overriding an option that is an array, the configurations
    | are merged together using php's array_merge() function. This means that
    | any option that you list here will take presence during a conflict in keys.
    |
    | EXAMPLE: The following addition to this file, will add another entry in
    | the common_definitions collection
    |
    |   'common_definitions' =>
    |   [
    |       [
    |           'match' => '*_at',
    |           'set' => [
    |               'css-class' => 'datetime-picker',
    |           ],
    |       ],
    |   ],

    |
    | You can use Laravel Storage filesystem. By default, the code-generator
    | uses the default file system.
